### PROMPT_TEXT
Maine ek Book-based RAG Chatbot banaya hai lekin chatbot properly kaam nahi kar raha. Mujhe lagta hai ke backend incomplete hai ya kisi configuration / integration ka issue hai.

Please is pure project ka review karo (backend + RAG flow) aur clearly batao:

Backend mein kya missing ya galat hai

RAG pipeline (document loading, embeddings, vector store, retrieval, response generation) sahi tarah connect hai ya nahi

Chatbot response kyun generate nahi kar raha

Aur kaun se specific issues hain jin ki wajah se chatbot working nahi hai

Step-by-step explain karo ke problem kya hai aur us ka solution kya hoga.

### RESPONSE_TEXT
I will perform a comprehensive review of your Book-based RAG Chatbot project, including the backend and RAG flow. This will involve identifying missing or incorrect backend components, verifying the RAG pipeline's connectivity, determining why the chatbot isn't generating responses, and outlining any other specific issues preventing its functionality. I will then explain each problem and its solution in a step-by-step manner.
