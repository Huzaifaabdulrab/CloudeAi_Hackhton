# Implementation Plan: Python CLI Todo Application

**Branch**: `001-cli-todo-app` | **Date**: 2025-12-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-cli-todo-app/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the development of a Python command-line Todo application. The application will allow users to manage tasks (add, update, delete, view, complete) which are persisted in a local JSON file. The application will feature a dual-interaction model, supporting both an interactive menu and direct command-line arguments.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: `argparse` (for CLI argument parsing), `rich` (for interactive menu and formatted output)
**Storage**: Local JSON file (e.g., `tasks.json`)
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: App startup < 2s with 1000 tasks, User operations < 1s.
**Constraints**: Must run in a standard Python environment with minimal external dependencies.
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, local application. Designed to handle a task list up to a few thousand entries efficiently.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **[✅] I. Spec-Driven Development**: This plan is derived from a detailed feature specification.
- **[✅] II. Agent-First Implementation**: All code and artifacts will be generated by the designated AI agent.
- **[✅] III. Clean and Modular Code**: The proposed file structure promotes separation of concerns (data, persistence, presentation).
- **[✅] IV. JSON-Based Persistence**: The application state will be stored in a local JSON file as mandated.
- **[✅] V. Application Archetype: Console Todo App**: The project adheres to its defined archetype.

All constitutional principles are met.

```

**Structure Decision**: A "Single project" structure is chosen for its simplicity, which is appropriate for a small-scale CLI application. This structure clearly separates concerns: `models.py` for data structure, `database.py` for persistence logic, `cli.py` for user interaction, and `main.py` as the entry point.
