# Python Console Todo App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
All development MUST follow the Agentic Dev Stack: specification → plan → tasks. This ensures that all work is deliberate, well-architected, and directly traces back to user requirements.

### II. Agent-First Implementation
All code and project artifacts MUST be generated by the designated AI agent. No manual coding is permitted. This is to maintain a purely agent-driven workflow and ensure all development adheres to the specified automated processes.

### III. Clean and Modular Code
The codebase MUST adhere to clean code principles, including a modular Python structure, clear separation of concerns, meaningful naming, and readable logic. This ensures the project is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand for both humans and AI agents.

### IV. JSON-Based Persistence
Application state and user data MUST be persisted in a JSON file. In-memory storage is not to be used for primary data persistence. This ensures data durability across application sessions in a simple, human-readable format.

### V. Application Archetype: Console Todo App
The project is a Python console-based Todo application. This defines the core scope and platform for the project.

## Governance
This constitution is the single source of truth for project principles. All development activities, code reviews, and architectural decisions must align with it. Amendments require team consensus and must be documented.
